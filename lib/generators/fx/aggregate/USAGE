Description:
  Create a new database aggregate for your application. This will create a new aggregate definition file and the accompanying migration.

  When --no-migration is passed, skips generating a migration.

Examples:
    rails generate fx:aggregate test

      create: db/aggregates/test_v01.sql
      create: db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_create_test_aggregate.rb
